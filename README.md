# Polymorhism

__Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of the OOP (Object Oriented Programming).__ Polymorphism is a word composed of two Greek words: _poly_, which means _many_, and _morph_, which means _forms_. Therefore, _polymorphism means many forms_. 

More precisely, in the OOP context, _polymorphism allows an object to behave differently in certain cases_, or, in other words allows an action to be accomplished  in different ways (approaches). _One way to implement polymorphism [in Java] is via method overloading. This is know as Compile-Time Polymorphism_ because the  compiler can identify at compile time which form of an overloaded method to call (multiple methods with the same name but different arguments). So, depending on which form of the overloaded method is called, the object behaves differently. For example, a class named <code> Triangle </code> can define multiple methods named <code>draw()</code> with different arguments.
